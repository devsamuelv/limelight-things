# Starter FRC Project

## Getting Started

Cloning the project requires a special flag because of the included libraries (core, swerve-lib), In order to do this use the `--recurse-submodule` flag when cloning.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ThePinkAlliance/Starter-Project-FRC.git --recurse-submodules
```
